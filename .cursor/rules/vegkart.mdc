# Vegkart Project Rules

## Geometry Handling
- All geometry data is stored in UTM33 (EPSG:25833)
- Use GeoJSON format for geometry transfer between DuckDB and OpenLayers
- Avoid unnecessary SRID transformations when querying geometries

## DuckDB Query Rules
- Use spatial extensions for geometry operations
- Prefer direct extent-based queries over SRID transformations
- Use prepared statements for repeated queries
- Handle missing/null values in JSON data gracefully

## Map Component Rules
- Map component should handle UTM33 coordinates directly
- Use OpenLayers VectorLayer for veglenker visualization
- Implement efficient feature loading based on view extent
- Use GeoJSON for feature creation and updates

## Data Sync Rules
- Maintain sync state in DuckDB for tracking progress
- Use batch processing for large data imports
- Handle missing/null values in JSON data gracefully
- Implement proper error handling and state management
